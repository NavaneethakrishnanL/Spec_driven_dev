# 📘 Spec-Driven Development (SDD) in Python

*A full example project using FastAPI + OpenAPI + Pydantic*

This repository demonstrates how to build an API using **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)**, where the **specification is created first** and becomes the **single source of truth** for:

* API routes
* Request/response models
* Validation
* Implementation
* Testing

# 🚀 Getting Started

Follow the steps below to run the project.

---

## 1️⃣ Install Dependencies

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
```

Install required packages:

```
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic datamodel-code-generator pytest
```

---

## 2️⃣ Understand the Spec (`openapi.yaml`)

All functionality comes from this file:

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: User Service
  version: "1.0"
paths:
  /users/{user_id}:
    get:
      summary: Get a user by ID
      parameters:
        - in: path
          name: user_id
          required: true
          schema:
            type: integer
      responses:
        "200":
          description: OK
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: "#/components/schemas/User"
        "404":
          description: User not found

components:
  schemas:
    User:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: integer
        name:
          type: string
      required: [id, name]
```

This file defines:

* routes
* parameters
* responses
* JSON model shapes

---

## 3️⃣ Generate the Models

Run:

```
datamodel-codegen --input openapi.yaml --input-file-type=openapi --output models.py
```

This creates the `models.py` file automatically.

Sample generated file:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
```

If the spec changes → regenerate this file.

---

## 4️⃣ Run the FastAPI App

Start the API server:

```
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Open the docs in the browser:

* Swagger UI → [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
* ReDoc → [http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc)

---

## 5️⃣ Run Tests

This project uses pytest.

```
pytest
```

Example tests include checking:

* valid user response
* missing user response (404)

# 📌 How Spec-Driven Development Works

### 1. Define the API in `openapi.yaml`

This is the **source of truth**.

### 2. Generate the models

Tools ensure 100% consistency with the spec.

### 3. Implement the API

Implementation MUST follow the spec.

### 4. Test using pytest & spec-based tools

You can also use Schemathesis:

```
schemathesis run openapi.yaml --base-url=http://localhost:8000
```

### 5. Change the spec → regenerate models

The implementation will break if it does not match the updated spec.
This ensures strict contract correctness.

---

# 🧠 Why Use Spec-Driven Development?

* Guarantees consistent API design
* Enforces strict contracts between backend, frontend, and clients
* Enables auto-generated documentation
* Avoids mismatched request/response formats
* Simplifies onboarding
* Prevents breaking changes
